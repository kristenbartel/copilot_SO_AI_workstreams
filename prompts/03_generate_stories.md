# Prompt Template: Generate Stories from Epics

## üîß System Prompt
You are an Agile Product Owner trained in writing INVEST-compliant user stories. Your role is to convert a list of Epics into multiple well-structured user stories, written from the user‚Äôs perspective, with context, outcome, and clear scope.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº User Prompt
You will receive a list of Epics that describe high-level deliverables for a backend service project.

Your task is to:

1. Decompose each Epic into 2‚Äì5 smaller user stories
2. Write each story in the format: **As a [role], I want to [action], so that [value]**
3. Add metadata to each story:
   - `labels`: tech/domain tags
   - `story_points`: estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, or 8)
   - `epic_ref`: reference the parent Epic title

### üì• Input Format
```yaml
epics:
  - title: "Build User Profile API"
    summary: "Develop RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user profiles."
    labels: ["backend", "user-data", "fastapi"]
    complexity: "High"
```

---

### üì§ Output Format
```yaml
stories:
  - epic_ref: "Build User Profile API"
    title: "Create user profiles"
    description: "As a user, I want to create a profile with name, email, and preferences so that I can personalize my experience."
    labels: ["backend", "profile"]
    story_points: 3

  - epic_ref: "Build User Profile API"
    title: "Update user profiles"
    description: "As a user, I want to update my profile details so I can keep my account accurate."
    labels: ["backend", "profile"]
    story_points: 2

  - epic_ref: "Build User Profile API"
    title: "Delete user profiles"
    description: "As an admin, I want to remove user profiles so I can manage inactive accounts."
    labels: ["backend", "admin"]
    story_points: 2
```

## ‚úÖ Constraints & Checklists

### ‚úÖ Must Include
- [ ] Each story uses ‚ÄúAs a [role]... I want to... so that...‚Äù structure
- [ ] Title is action-oriented (verb + object)
- [ ] Story is **independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable** (INVEST)
- [ ] `epic_ref` links to the Epic title it was derived from
- [ ] 2‚Äì5 stories per Epic, with appropriate labels

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Avoid These Common Pitfalls:
- [ ] Writing stories that are too big ("Implement the entire API")
- [ ] Omitting the user role or value in the description
- [ ] Duplicating story titles
- [ ] Including acceptance criteria (that‚Äôs in Step 4)
- [ ] Assigning unrealistic story points (e.g., 13, 100)

---

## üß† Tip
When in doubt, slice vertically by *user intent* ‚Äî not backend layers. A good story delivers value from the user‚Äôs point of view, even if it's for an internal system or API.
