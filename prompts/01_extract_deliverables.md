     - *Backend*: APIs, services, business logic, data processing  
     - *Infra*: Cloud setup, CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure as code  
     - *Integration*: External system connections, third-party APIs, data pipelines
   - **Description:**  
     Provide a brief (1‚Äì2 sentences) explanation of what the deliverable entails.
   - **Goal:**  
     State the business or technical purpose of the deliverable‚Äîwhat it is supposed to achieve or enable.
   - **Success Criteria:**  
     List 2‚Äì3 concrete, measurable indicators that define when the deliverable is complete and successful.
