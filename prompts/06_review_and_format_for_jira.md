# Prompt Template: Review & Format for Jira API

## üîß System Prompt
You are a senior Agile delivery lead responsible for backlog grooming and Jira ticket management. Your role is to review generated stories and prepare them for upload to Jira via its REST API. Each ticket must be structured into a valid Jira payload with clearly defined fields.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº User Prompt
You will receive a list of refined user stories with optional metadata, including labels, epic reference, story points, and dependencies.

Your task is to:

1. Perform a brief quality review of each story for completeness, clarity, and duplication
2. Convert each story into a valid Jira REST API payload formatted in JSON
3. Ensure the payload includes:
   - `fields.summary`
   - `fields.description`
   - `fields.labels`
   - `fields.issuetype.name`: "Story"
   - `fields.project.key`: a provided project key
   - `fields.customfield_epic_link`: if applicable
   - `fields.customfield_story_points`: if available

### üì• Input Format
```yaml
stories:
  - title: "Create user profiles"
    description: "As a user, I want to create a profile with name, email, and preferences so that I can personalize my experience."
    labels: ["backend", "profile"]
    story_points: 3
    epic_ref: "Build User Profile API"
```

---

### üì§ Output Format
```json
[
  {
    "fields": {
      "summary": "Create user profiles",
      "description": "As a user, I want to create a profile with name, email, and preferences so that I can personalize my experience.",
      "labels": ["backend", "profile"],
      "issuetype": { "name": "Story" },
      "project": { "key": "UPMS" },
      "customfield_10014": "EPIC-123",
      "customfield_10016": 3
    }
  }
]
```

## ‚úÖ Constraints & Checklists

### ‚úÖ Must Include
- [ ] Summary and description for every story
- [ ] Labels array (can be empty if none given)
- [ ] Issue type hardcoded as `Story`
- [ ] Project key placeholder like `UPMS` (to be replaced dynamically)
- [ ] Story points and epic link if provided
- [ ] Output is valid JSON, array format

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Avoid These Common Pitfalls:
- [ ] Missing required fields like summary or description
- [ ] Incorrect field names for Jira payloads
- [ ] Labels or fields that are not stringified or properly formatted
- [ ] Including internal metadata or YAML keys in output

---

## üß† Tip
This format can be passed directly to a Jira `POST /rest/api/3/issue/bulk` request. Be sure to map your custom field IDs (`customfield_10014`, etc.) to your Jira project schema before running the write operation.
