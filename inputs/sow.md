# Statement of Work: User Management Backend Service

## Project Overview
This Statement of Work outlines the development of a comprehensive User Management Backend Service that will serve as the core authentication and user data management system for our enterprise application ecosystem.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a scalable, secure backend service for user authentication and management
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Provide RESTful APIs for user operations
- Ensure GDPR and data privacy compliance
- Integrate with existing enterprise systems

## Scope of Work

### 1. User Authentication System
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- JWT token management
- Session management
- Password policy enforcement
- Account lockout mechanisms

### 2. User Profile Management
- User registration and onboarding
- Profile CRUD operations
- Avatar and file upload capabilities
- User preferences management
- Account deactivation/deletion

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Role definition and management
- Permission assignment system
- Hierarchical role structures
- Dynamic permission evaluation
- Audit trail for access changes

### 4. API Development
- RESTful API endpoints
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging

### 5. Security Features
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- SQL injection prevention
- CSRF protection
- Input sanitization
- Security headers implementation

### 6. Integration Requirements
- LDAP/Active Directory integration
- Third-party SSO providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- Email service integration for notifications
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Redis for caching and session storage
